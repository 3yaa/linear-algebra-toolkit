# Linear Algebra Toolkit

A Python-based application designed to perform a variety of linear algebra operations. The toolkit offers functionalities such as matrix transpose, determinant calculation, matrix inversion, row echelon form (REF), reduced row echelon form (RREF), rank determination, eigenvalue computation, LU and QR decomposition, and solving systems of linear equations. The application features a user-friendly interface built with the Tkinter library and is thoroughly tested with unit tests to ensure the accuracy of all operations.

## How to run

```bash
../linear-algebra-toolkit$ ./toolkit
